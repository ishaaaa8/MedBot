# MedBot: AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant


## üìã Overview

MedBot is an advanced AI-powered healthcare assistant designed to transform how patients access and interact with medical assistance. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), MedBot provides personalized, context-aware medical information tailored to individual users.

The project addresses key healthcare challenges including prescription interpretation difficulties, limited access to healthcare professionals, information overload, and gaps in mental health monitoring.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Prescription Parsing**: Upload and interpret handwritten prescriptions using AWS Textract and custom NER models
- **Contextual Medical Chatbot**: Get personalized medical information through a RAG-based architecture
- **Mental Health Monitoring**: Benefit from sentiment analysis to detect potential mental health concerns
- **Secure Local Deployment**: Ensure privacy with locally deployed language models (DeepSeek-1.1B)
- **Personalized Healthcare Knowledge**: Access personalized recommendations based on your medical history
